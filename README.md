# gtm-custom-ctas-tracking
This snippet is for digital marketers who trying to solve the issue of adding tracking tags to the CTAs on the funnels through Google tag manager custom tags

This will help you to have the right utm tracking across your domain without waiting for developers to manually change the CTAs. 

you should be mindful and have a clear business logic when you are going to override tracking tags. 

Business logic behind this function: 
1. you have embeded CTA from another platform and don't have access to add tracking parameters to it. 
2. you want to add tracking tags to global css selector ( like footer, header or signup)
